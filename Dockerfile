# Stage 2: Serve the application with Caddy

# This makes the Caddyfile configuration much cleaner and easier to read.

# Caddy's default static file server serves from /usr/share/caddy
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/caddy

# Expose port 80 for web traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Caddy will automatically run as the main process due to the base image's ENTRYPOINT
# No CMD instruction is typically needed here, as Caddy will use the Caddyfile.
